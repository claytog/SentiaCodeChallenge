# Sentia Code Challenge

This is the Sentia Code Challenge app.<br />
The opening view displays a list of properties that are fetched from the web service.

The list displays the photo of the property, and other attributes such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and car spaces.<br />
The name and avatar of the agent is also displayed.

Selecting a property will open a view displaying the property id.

The app supports changing the orientation between portrait and landscape modes.<br />
The app will run on both iPad and iPhone.

Note: The first property image is not being rendered, as there appears to be authenication required for the endpoint.<br />
